# [5.0.0](https://github.com/sapegin/mrm/compare/mrm-task-semantic-release@4.1.1...mrm-task-semantic-release@5.0.0) (2021-04-07)


### Features

* Autoload tasks and presets ([#99](https://github.com/sapegin/mrm/issues/99)) ([b866455](https://github.com/sapegin/mrm/commit/b866455f98c72b7698ec7cc5fb277df3b3f9ce25)), closes [#97](https://github.com/sapegin/mrm/issues/97)
* Increase supported node version from 8 to 10 ([#138](https://github.com/sapegin/mrm/issues/138)) ([224c673](https://github.com/sapegin/mrm/commit/224c67332ee71b9e275dbea1435cd9088852ff6f))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* Node 8 or 9 are no longer supported, the minimum supported version is now 10.13.
* Mrm will no longer load globally installed tasks and presets but will autoload them directly from npm, similar to how npx works (we're actually using npx under the hood).
